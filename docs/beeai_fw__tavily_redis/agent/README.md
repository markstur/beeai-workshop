# Running the Agent

> ⚠️ **Before you begin:**  
> Make sure you’ve completed the [Prework](../pre-work/README.md) and [Setup](../setup/README.md) sections.  
> Your `.env` must include a Tavily API key, your redis stack must be running, and you either need an **OpenAI API key** or your **local Ollama model** must be running.

---

## Step 1: Verify Environment

1. Navigate to the working directory:

    ```bash
    cd beeai-workshop/beeai_fw_tavily_redis
    ```

2. Sync dependencies:

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

---

## Step 2: Prepare to Run the Agent

1. Navigate to the following file:

    ```text
    src/agent.py
    ```

2. This file contains **fill-in-the-blank** sections. Follow the in-line comments to complete the logic.

    - **Uncomment the language model** you intend to use:
        - Use `OpenAI` if your API key is in `.env`
        - Use `Ollama` if you're running `granite3.3:8b` locally

    If you are using **Ollama**, run this command in a new terminal:

    ```bash
    ollama run granite3.3:8b
    ```

    If you are using **OpenAI**, your `.env` file must include your API key:

    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
    ```

    - Be sure to **add the tools you implemented earlier** (Tavily MCP Tool and Redis Retriever).
    - You can read more about tool usage in the BeeAI Framework here:  
        👉 [Tool Usage Documentation](https://framework.beeai.dev/modules/tools)

## Step 3: Build the Agent

1. Read the `system_prompt` variable in the file.  
It defines how the assistant should behave and respond to users.

2. Add the custom `tools` that we built in the previous sections to the agent to enable it with internet search and RAG capabilities.

3. Explore the `conditional_requirements` section — this allows you to control **how and when** the agent should use a specific tool.

## Step 4: Run the Agent

Execute or debug the agent script:

```bash
uv run src/agent.py
```

> Remember to save the file with your changes before running it!

You’ll be prompted to enter a question in your terminal! You can ask your own or try one of these examples:

### Sample Questions

- Tell me about the new pilot. Who is the target audience?
- What options do we have for vegetarians?
- I haven't gotten my order of french fries for 3 days and we are running low. This will start to affect operations. What do I do?
- Who do I call if there is an event in my store and I think it might turn into a PR emergency?

> 💡 If asking your own questions, remember:  
> The agent only knows what’s in its vector store documents and what the prompt instructs it to do. If you'd like to expand the agent scope to include more documents in the RAG search or more custom tools, use this workshop as a starting point and go wild!
