# Workshop Overview: Company Analysis Agent with the BeeAI Framework

In this workshop, you’ll be using the **BeeAI Framework** in partnership with **Tavily** and **Redis** to build a company analysis agent that demonstrates modern AI techniques in an enterprise context. Each section **includes interactive coding activities** where you’ll fill in missing code and run the files to test your progress.

## What You’ll Build

You’ll create a company analysis agent with access to three key tools:

1. **Tavily MCP Tool** – A locally run Tavily server used to perform real-time web searches
2. **Redis Retriever** – Connects to a Redis vector store and retrieves relevant internal knowledge
3. **Thinking Tool** – A reasoning module that enables the agent to follow a ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern with chain-of-thought reasoning  
   👉 Read more about this pattern here: [IBM: ReAct Agent](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/react-agent)

> 🛑 **Disclaimer**:  
> This is a demo application. **McDonald’s** is used purely as a real-world example for showcasing search-based functionality.

## Workshop Structure

To ensure a smooth experience, follow the steps in this order:

1. ✅ [Prework](../pre-work/README.md) – Install dependencies and gather API keys
2. 🔧 [Setup](../setup/README.md) – Get the code and environment ready
3. 🛠️ [Create Tools](../tools/README.md) – Build the Tavily and Redis RAG tools
