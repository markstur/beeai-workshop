# Workshop Setup Instructions

## Get the Workshop Code

**Option A: Clone with Git (Recommended):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/beeai-workshop.git
```

**Option B: Download ZIP:**

If you're not comfortable with Git, [download the ZIP](https://github.com/IBM/beeai-workshop/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) file and extract it to your desired location.

---

## Open the Workshop in VS Code

Navigate to the specific workshop folder and open it in VS Code:

```bash
cd beeai-workshop/[INSERT NAME]
code .
```

**Important:**  
Make sure to open the specific `[NAME]` folder in VS Code, not the entire `beeai-workshop` directory.  
This ensures proper project structure and dependencies are detected.

Alternatively, you can open VS Code first and use `File > Open Folder` to navigate to and select the correct folder.

---

## Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file based on the existing `env.template` at the `[INSERT NAME]` directory level.  
Add your **Tavily** key and optionally your **OpenAI** key to this file.

```bash
cp env.template .env
```

---

## Install Project Dependencies

1. **Activate the virtual environment created by `uv`:**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. **Install all required dependencies:**

```bash
uv sync
```

This ensures you have the correct versions of all packages used in the workshop, installed in the correct environment.

## Populate the Vector Database

To prepare your Redis vector database for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):

1. **Activate the correct Python environment (if not already activated):**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. **Ensure the correct kernel is selected:**

The notebook should use the Python environment from your `.venv`. If it’s not available in the kernel list:

- Open the Command Palette in VS Code (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
- Select `Python: Select Interpreter`
- If your `.venv` is not listed, add it manually:
  - Choose `Enter interpreter path`
  - Browse to:

    ```text
    beeai-tavily-redis/.venv/bin/python
    ```

  - Select that path to register and use it as the kernel

This ensures all required packages and dependencies are correctly loaded in the notebook environment.

3. **Run the Jupyter notebook:**

Run the following Jupyter notebook cell by cell:

```bash
redis_vector_db.ipynb
```
