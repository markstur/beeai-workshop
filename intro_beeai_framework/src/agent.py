#  ## 1️⃣ LLM Providers: Choose Your AI Engine

# BeeAI Framework supports 10+ LLM providers including Ollama, Groq, OpenAI, Watsonx.ai, and more, giving you flexibility to choose local or hosted models based on your needs. In this workshop we'll be working Ollama, so you will be running the model locally. You can find the documentation on how to connect to other providers [here](https://framework.beeai.dev/modules/backend).
# ### *❗* Exercise: Select your Language Model Provider
# Change the `PROVIDER_ID` and `MODEL_ID` in your .env file. If you select a provider that requires an API key, please replace the placeholder with your `api_key`.
# Try several models to see how your agent performs. Note that you may need to modify the system prompt for each model, as they all have their own system prompt best practice.

PROVIDER_ID = os.getenv("PROVIDER_ID")
MODEL_ID = os.getenv("MODEL_ID")

# Load the chat model
llm = ChatModel.from_name(MODEL_NAME, ChatModelParameters(temperature=1))

# Load the embedding model
# TODO: this should be configurable in the .env too
embedding_model = EmbeddingModel.from_name("ollama:nomic-embed-text")

# Create the A2A Server

# ## 2️⃣ Understanding System Prompts: The Agent's Foundation

# What is a System Prompt?
# A system prompt is the foundational instruction that defines your agent's identity, role, and behavior. Think of it as the agent's "job description" and "training manual" rolled into one. Each model responds differently to the same system prompt, so experimentation is necessary.
# 
# Some key components of a strong system prompt:
# 
# - Identity: Who is the agent?
# - Role: What is their function?
# - Context: What environment are they operating in?
# - Rules: What constraints and guidelines must they follow?
# - Knowledge: What domain-specific information do they need?

# ###*❗* Exercise: Customize Your System Prompt
# Try modifying the system prompt. Customize the "basic rules" section to add your own. Note that changes to the system prompt will affect the performance of the model. Creating a great `System Prompt` is an art, not a science.

todays_date = date.today().strftime("%B %d, %Y")
instruct_prompt = f"""You help field marketing teams prep for conferences by answering questions on companies that they need to prepare to talk to. You produce quick and actionable briefs, doing your best to anwer the user's question.

Today's date is {todays_date}.

Tools:
- ThinkTool: Helps you plan and reason before you act. Use this tool when you need to think.
- DuckDuckGoSearchTool: Use this tool to collect current information on agendas, speakers, news, competitor moves. Include title + date + link to the resources you find in your answer. Do not use this tool for internal notes or artifacts.
- wikipedia_tool: Use this tool to get company/org history (not for breaking news). Only look up company names as the input.
- internal_document_search: past meetings, playbooks, artifacts. If you use information from this in yoour response, label it as as [Internal]. Always use this tool when internal notes or content is references.

Basic Rules:
- Be concise and practical.
- Favor recent info (agenda/news ≤30 days; exec changes/funding ≤180 days); flag older items.
- If you don't know, say so. Don't make things up.

# ## 4️⃣ Tools: Enabling LLMs to Take Action
# 
# What Are Tools?
# Tools are external capabilities that extend your agent beyond just generating text. They can be API calls, code, or even calls to other AI models. They can allow agents to:
# 
# - Access real-time data (internet search, API calls to live data)
# - Perform calculations (using code generation tools)
# - Interact with APIs (databases, web services)
# - Process files (call functions that read, modify, or write files)
# - Interact with `MCP Servers`
# 
# The BeeAI framework provides [built in tools](https://framework.beeai.dev/modules/tools#built-in-tools) for common tool types, but also provides the ability to create [custom tools](https://framework.beeai.dev/modules/tools#creating-custom-tools).

# ### Adding Framework Provided Tools

# The **Think tool** encourages a Re-Act pattern where the agent reasons and plans before calling a tool.
think_tool = ThinkTool()

# The **DuckDuckGoSearchTool** is a Web Search tool that provides relevant data from the internet to the LLM
search_tool = DuckDuckGoSearchTool()

# ### Adding Custom Tools

# There are 2 ways to provide custom tools to your agent. For simple tools you can use the `@tool` decorator above the function. For more complex tools, you can extend the `Tool Class` and customize things such as the run time and tool execution.  
# We will create a simple custom tool with the `@tool` decorator. Our tool must have a doc string, so that the agent understands when and how it should use that tool. The tool name will defualt to the function name.
# To learn more about advanced tool customization, take a look at this section in the [documentation](https://framework.beeai.dev/modules/tools#advanced-custom-tool).


@tool
async def wikipedia_tool(query: str) -> str:
    """

        query: The topic or question to search for on Wikipedia.

    Returns:
        The information found via searching Wikipedia.

    tool = WikipediaTool(language=language)
    response = await tool.run(input=WikipediaToolInput(query=query, full_text=full_text))
    return response.get_text_content()


# ## 5️⃣ Creating a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Tool to Search Internal Documents

# `RAG` (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is “search + write”: you ask a question, the system retrieves the most relevant snippets from an indexed knowledge base (via embeddings) and the model composes an answer grounded in those snippets.
# 
# **We created synthetic (made-up) documents to simulate a company knowledge base:**
# - Security checklists
# - Call notes
# - Artifacts
# 
# We made sets of these for Spotify, Siemens, and Moderna.
# 
# **Important:** This is demonstration-only data and does not reflect real information about those companies.

# The BeeAI Framework has built in abstractions to make RAG simple to implement. Read more about it [here](https://framework.beeai.dev/modules/rag).

# First, we must pull an embedding model which converts text into numerical vectors so we can compare meanings and retrieve the most relevant snippets. The original document is:
# 1. preprocessed (cleaned + broken into chunks)
# 2. ran through the embedding algorithm
# 3. stored in the vector database
# 


async def get_vector_store():
    # ### *❗* Exercise: Internal documents
    # Take a look at the internal documents, so you know what type of questions to ask your agent
    #
    # Load the document using the `DocumentLoader` and split the document into chunks using the `text_splitter`.
    loader = DocumentLoader.from_name(
        name="langchain:UnstructuredMarkdownLoader", file_path="rag_conference_prep_agent.txt"
    )
    try:
        documents = await loader.load()

        print(f"Failed to load documents: {e}")
        raise
    # Split documents into chunks
    text_splitter = TextSplitter.from_name(
        name="langchain:RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter", chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200
    )
    documents = await text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
    print(f"Loaded {len(documents)} document chunks")

    # Create the `TemporalVectorStore`, which means this vector store also tracks time.
    # Create vector store and add documents
    vector_store = VectorStore.from_name(name="beeai:TemporalVectorStore", embedding_model=embedding_model)
    await vector_store.add_documents(documents=documents)
    print("Vector store populated with documents")
    return vector_store


# ## 6️⃣ Conditional Requirements: Guiding Agent Behavior
# 

# ## Explore Observability: See what is happening under the hood

# Create the function that sets up observability using `OpenTelemetry` and [Arize's Phoenix Platform](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/inferences/how-to-inferences/manage-the-app). There a several ways to view what is happening under the hood of your agent. View the observability documentation [here](https://framework.beeai.dev/modules/observability).

    # Create the vector store search tool
    internal_document_search = VectorStoreSearchTool(vector_store=await get_vector_store())

    # What Are Conditional Requirements?
    # [Conditional requirements](https://framework.beeai.dev/experimental/requirement-agent#conditional-requirement) ensure your agents are reliable by controlling when and how tools are used. They're like business rules for agent behavior. You can make them as strict (esentially writing a static workflow) or flexible (no rules! LLM decides) as you'd like.
    #
    # The rules that you enforce may seem simple in the BeeAI framework, but in other frameworks they require ~5X the amount of code. Check out this [blog](https://beeai.dev/blog/reliable-ai-agents) where we built the same agent in BeeAI and other agent framework LangGraph.

    # These conditional requirements enforce the following in only 3 lines of code:
    # 1. The agent must call the think tool as the first tool call. It is not allowed to call it consecutive times in a row.
    # 2. The wikipedia_tool can only be called after the think tool, but not consecutively. It has a relative priority of 10.
    # 3. The DuckDuckGo Internet search tool can also only be called after the Think tool, it is allowed to be called up to 3 times, it must be invoked at least once, and it has a relative priority of 15.
    # 4. The internal_document_search tool can only be called after the think tool, it is allowed to be called multiple times in a row, it must be called at least once, and it has a relative priority of 20.
    #

# ### *❗* Exercise: Test Your Agent
# Remember that your agent is meant to prep the field marketing team for upcoming conferences and has a limited set of "internal documents". Make up your own question or ask one of the sample ones below!
# 
# 
# **Sample Questions:**
# - Brief me for a Shopify meeting at the conference. Give me an overview of the company, some recent news about them, and anything important I need to know from our internal notes.
# 
# - I'm planning on meeting the Moderna rep at the next conference. Give me a one pager and remind me where we left off on previous discussions.
# 
# - Build a security talking sheet for Siemens Energy. How does their strategy compare to their competitors'?

# Run the agent with specific execution settings.

# ### *❗* Exercise: Test Your Agent
# Change the execution settings and see what happens. Does your agent run out of iterations? Every task is different and its important to balance flexibility with control.
